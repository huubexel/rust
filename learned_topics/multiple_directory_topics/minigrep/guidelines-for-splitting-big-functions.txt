The guidelines are as follows:
- Split your program into a main.rs and a lib.rs and move your programâ€™s logic to lib.rs.
- As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in main.rs.
- When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs and move it to lib.rs.

The responsibilities that remain in the main function after this process should be limited to the following:
- Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
- Setting up any other configuration
- Calling a run function in lib.rs
- Handling the error if run returns an error
